# Write with Abandon

This is a itty bitty web app to encourage disposable creative writing.

* You type into a box
* If you stop typing, a countdown starts
* At the end of the countdown, your hard work is deleted

I wanted something low stakes to do daily for just a few minutes,
like I do playing piano. This app guarantees that I don't get attached
to what I write, because it's gonna go away in a few seconds anyway;
it encourages me to "just keep writing."
